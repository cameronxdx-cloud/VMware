## What is NSX-T?
- NSX-T is **VMware's network hypervisor**.
- Enables **layer 2 to layer 7 networking services** in software:
  - Routing
  - VPN
  - Load balancing
- Provides **network virtualization** and **security services**:
  - Distributed firewall
  - Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS)
  - Support for **third-party firewall integration**
- Acts as a **core component** of a **Software-Defined Data Center (SDDC)**:
  - Complements:
    - **vSphere** (compute virtualization)
    - **vSAN** (storage virtualization)

---

## Monitoring & Visibility
- NSX-T includes **built-in tools** for:
  - **Monitoring** network traffic
  - **Visualizing** data flow
- Helps track network behavior across the environment.
